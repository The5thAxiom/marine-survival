## How to Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
- The `Annotation` class requires annotation files in a particular format.
- The `data-processing/data-wrangling.ipynb` file performs the conversion (you might have to change some file paths and it should work).
- The custom format has annotations for each frame grouped by 1 video per file in the mobdrone dataset.
